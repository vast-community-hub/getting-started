# Let's Get Started!
The **VAST Community Hub** is a collaboration between Instantiations and the Smalltalk community to create a home for the best open source projects for the VAST Platform (VA Smalltalk). As of VAST 9.2.1, developers can export VA Smalltalk code in Tonel format, version it with git, and make it available on GitHub.

You'll find useful and fun projects alike in this collection, and we're looking forward to seeing what repositories the community creates.

We'd like more teams to get involved, so if you're interesting in helping or contributing to the VAST Community Hub, please reach out to vast-community-hub@instantiations.com.<br><br>
 
## Using code from the repos:

1. To use the repos here, you'll need to be a VAST Platform (VA Smalltalk) license holder (commercial, open source, or trial).
<br><br>
*If you're not a licensee of the VAST Platform, go to [https://www.instantiations.com/eval](https://www.instantiations.com/eval) to fill out the form for a free trial, or check to see if you qualify for an open source license: [https://www.instantiations.com/opensource](https://www.instantiations.com/opensource)*<br><br>
2. Next, to load Smalltalk code from a repository into the VAST Platform, you'll need to install Tonel (compatible with VAST 9.2.1 or higher). Find it at: https://github.com/instantiations/tonel-vast <br><br>
3. For instructions on using Tonel and the VAST Platform, consult the "Quick Start" guide within the Tonel repo readme: https://github.com/instantiations/tonel-vast <br><br>
 
 
## Making your own repos on the VAST Community Hub:

Thanks for wanting to get more involved!

1. Contact us at vast-community-hub@instantiations.com to request a member role. Please tell us about yourself and what projects you'd like to do.<br><br>

2. While we get your member role setup, please take a look at the following standards we'd recommend using in the VAST Community Hub:
   * Please have all your VA Smalltalk projects tagged with at least the following topics for best discoverability:
     * smalltalk
     * vasmalltalk
     * vastplatform 
   * We encourage using an MIT license on projects.
   * Please include a "README.md" in your repo too.<br><br>

3. Once you've been made a member, please feel free to create some repos, add your projects, and invite collaborators.<br><br>
 
### We look forward to seeing the awesome things you create!
